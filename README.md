# File Sync

This bash script watches a directory for file modifications. It syncs these files to a remote server.    

## Installation

> Copy ```config.template.sh``` to ```.config.sh``` and update values. Next, run ```sync.sh```. That's all there is to it. Run in the background to keep it out of the way: ```sync.sh &```
